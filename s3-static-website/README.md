## Project: Host a Static Website on Amazon S3

This project demonstrates hosting a static website using Amazon S3.
The website is publicly accessible through an S3 website endpoint.

### What I Did
- Created an S3 bucket
- Uploaded a basic HTML website
- Enabled static website hosting
- Configured public access so the site could be viewed in a browser

### Files Uploaded to S3
- `index.html`
- `NextWork` folder
