This project demonstrates hosting a static website using Amazon S3. The website is publicly accessible through an S3 website endpoint.


What I did:
- Created an S3 bucket
- Uploaded a basic HTML website
- Enabled static website hosting
- Allowed public access so the site could be viewed in a browser
