This project demonstrates hosting a static website using Amazon S3. The website is publicly accessible through an S3 website endpoint.


What I did:
- Created an S3 bucket
- Uploaded a basic HTML website
- Enabled static website hosting
- Allowed public access so the site could be viewed in a browser


Files stored and uploaded into S3:
- NextWork Folder
- index.html 


I hosted the website on Amazon S3. The endpoint used to be:

http://your-bucket-name.s3-website-region.amazonaws.com

(Note: The site is no longer live.)
