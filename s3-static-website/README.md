This project demonstrates hosting a static website using Amazon S3. The website is publicly accessible through an S3 website endpoint.


What I did: 
- Created an S3 bucket ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7892cbda-17e4-4c09-a805-a1063ebee4c7)
- Uploaded a basic HTML website
- Enabled static website hosting
- Allowed public access so the site could be viewed in a browser

Files stored and uploaded into S3: 
- NextWork Folder
- index.html

I hosted the website on Amazon S3. The endpoint used to be:

http://my-static-website-jdrake.s3-website.us-east-2.amazonaws.com

(Note: The site is no longer live.)
